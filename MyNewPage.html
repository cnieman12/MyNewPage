<h1>One good tip to be successful in college</h1>
<p>One good tip that will lead you to good success in college is to set a goal for yourself for the end of the semester. This is for you to try and meet that goal while working throughout the semester and this will give you a reason to actually work hard so you can meet this goal. This tip helped me by setting a standard to work toward and giving myself something to achieve at the end of the semester.
